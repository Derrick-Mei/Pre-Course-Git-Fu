## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - a central location where data is stored and managed
 * Git - Version Control - software that allows multiple people to work on the same code at the         same time
 * Clone - to make a copy of the existing code
 * Fork - to create a branch of code that belongs to you
 * History - a copy of all the changes submitted
 * Staging - to prepare a file to be commited
 * Remote - a remote repository
 * Commit - records changes to the code
 * Push - submit the code to the repository
